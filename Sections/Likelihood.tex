\section{Likelihood}

In the current section,
the parameters \(\beta, \gamma, t^*\) will be considered to be distributed, according to some known distribution.
This makes the outcomes of the function \(t^{opt}(\beta, \gamma, t^*)\) defined above to be distributed itself.

The goal of the section is thus to find an analytical expression for the Probability Density Function that characterizes the distribution of the outcomes of the function \(t^{opt}\).
To this end, the characterization developed in the preceding section will be employed,
in a slightly simpler setting, in which some additional hypotheses on the travel time function are made.

The assumptions that simplify the estimation are shown in the following definition:
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:proper_tt}
  Let \(tt_a:\R\rightarrow\R\).

  \(tt_a\) is a \textbf{Proper Travel Time Function} if \(tt_a\) is a General Travel Time Function and,
  on top of this, 
  two points \(k_1\neq k_2 \in \R\) can be found such that
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \(tt_a|_{(k_1, k_2)}\) is concave
  \item \(tt_a|_{\R\setminus(k_1, k_2)}\) is convex
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\todo{Why is proper tt even realistic?}

For a proper travel time function,
the estimation of the optimal arrival time \(t^{opt}\) considerably simplifies:
the following observation shows how.
\begin{obs}
  Consider the problem of choosing an optimal departure time
  with a proper travel time function, and let \(\beta, \gamma\) be fixed.

  There exist two intervals \((t_e, \bar{t_e}), (\bar{t_l}, t_l)\) such that an on-time arrival \(t^{opt} = t^*\) is realized if and only if
  \begin{equation*}
    t^* \notin (t_e, \bar{t_e}) \cup (\bar{t_l}, t_l)
  \end{equation*}
\end{obs}

Note that this is exactly what said by Proposition~\ref{prop:into-early-late},
with a single difference:
the intervals are indeed here at most one (for each type of arrival), rather than an arbitrary number.

This is a consequence of the hypothesis on the travel time function:
the point \(t_e\) must indeed be an eligible early arrival and,
as shown in Lemma~\ref{lemma:bounded-der-tt} and~\ref{lemma:cost_decoupled},
any possible early arrival must satisfy two simple conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(tt_a'(t_e) = \beta\)
\item \(tt_a''(t_e) \geq 0\)
\end{enumerate}
where the second one derives from being a minimum:
if the second derivative was negative, the point was indeed a maximum.

But for a proper travel time function,
a point satisfying the conditions above can occur only once:
given the unimodality,
the function will be as shown in Figure\todo{ref}: increasing, with an increasing derivative,
for \(t < k_1\), and decreasing with an increasing derivative for \(t > k_2\).
Its derivative will thus be injective on the convex part \(\R \setminus (k_1, k_2)\),
that is the part we are interested in.
This shows that the set of possible \(t^*\) for which early arrivals occur is a single interval.
A similar reasoning holds for late arrivals.

Consider thus now the problem of finding the intervals \((t_e, \bar{t_e})\), \((\bar{t_l}, t_l)\).
The points in which the arrivals occur are now easy to estimate. Let
\begin{equation*}
  \beta_{max} = \max_t tt_a'(t)\qquad \gamma_{max} = -\min_t tt_a'(t)
\end{equation*}

The following functions are well defined:
\begin{align*}
  b_i: (0, \beta_{max}) & \rightarrow \R  & g_e: (0, \gamma_{max}) & \rightarrow \R \\
       \beta & \mapsto (tt_a' |_{(-\infty, k_1)})^{-1}(\beta) & \gamma & \mapsto(tt_a' |_{(k_2, \infty)})^{-1}(\gamma)
\end{align*}

Given \(\beta \in (0, \beta_{max})\),
the time \(b_i(\beta)\) will be the starting point of the interval in which early arrivals occur.

Similarly, given \(\gamma\) the time \(g_e(\gamma)\) will be the ending point of the interval in which the late arrivals occur.

Estimating the remaining point is slightly more difficult.
The expression in the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:into-early-late} can anyway be used:
the function \(b_e(\beta)\) (and \(g_i(\gamma)\))
are thus defined as the points in which the line tangent to the travel time function in \(b_i(\beta)\) (or, respectively, in \(g_e(\gamma)\)) intersects again with the travel time function.

A graphical representation of the functions \(b_i, b_e, g_i, g_e\) is shown in figure\todo{ref}
